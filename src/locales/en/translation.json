After I completed 12 years of school, I put my college dream on hold because I didn't have enough money to cover my living expenses. With my own efforts, I returned to college after 1 year. I started college with a limited amount of knowledge, which led to many difficulties for me to adapt. With my own efforts, I overcame that stage and found a direction for myself, which is to become a Front-end Developer (ReactJS) and am continuing to improve, aiming for a Full-Stack. Developer. I personally feel that I am not the best, but I can guarantee that I can become the most adaptable person.",
